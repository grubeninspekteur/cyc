<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

Use the drop down "Classes" in the menu to select a class or check out the "Globals" for the global variables.

If you are looking for a starting point, go to <a href="global.html">the globals</a> and start with the company object you always have.

To see an overview of <a href="classes.list.html">all classes</a> go here.

<h2>General hints</h2>

* You will never need to (and you cannot) create your own new objects. If you need something you can always get it from somewhere, for example
Food is delivered to company.foodDelivery = function(foodDelivery) after you have've ordered it via company.grocer.order(...).

<h2>Class categorization</h2>

The game has not too many classes and they all fall under 4 different categories:

* Central entities: ApplicationProfile, Company, Employee, Establishment, FoodUnit, Grocer, HumanResources, MenuEntry, RealEstateProfile 
* Containers (all behave also like a List): ApplicationProfiles, FoodDelivery, Menu, RealEstateProfiles
* Pure data transport classes: DailyStatistics, DataPair, Iterator, List, Set
* Utility classes: Console
